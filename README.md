<b>Overview</b><br>
Home Food Delivery App is a coding project worked on by Wasay Ahmed, Christian Gutierrez, Jordan Nguyen, and Natalie Reyes during Spring 2022 at University of Illinois at Chicago for the course CS 440 Software Engineering 1 taught by Professor John Bell.

The Home Food Delivery App is designed for home cooked food deliveries. The app has three main users: cook, customer, and driver. The cook can be any registered individual with the flexibility to create their own menu and sell their own food items. The customer can be any registered individual within proximity to order food items from the cook(s). The driver can be any registered individual within proximity to deliver food from the cook to the customer.

<b>Technologies Used:</b>
<br>- Android Studio with Java and XML to program the functionalities and design of the app
<br>- Google Firebase NoSQL database to store and manage data for each user in real time
<br>- Google Maps to provide navigation for the driver
