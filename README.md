# Home-Food-Delivery-App

The Home Food Delivery App is designed for home cooked food deliveries. The app has three main users: cook, customer, and driver. The cook can be any registered individual with the flexibility to create their own menu and sell their own food items. The customer can be any registered individual within proximity to order food items from the cook(s). The driver can be any registered individual within proximity to deliver food from the cook to the customer.

File "code" contains project demonstration slides, app report with extensive information including diagrams and tests, app summary, app scenario, and link to the code.
